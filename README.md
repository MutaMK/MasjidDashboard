# MasjidDashboard

A Google Sheets based dashboard for static screens in the masjid.


## Viewing the dashboard:

A simple way to download and run PHP with minimal setup is to download [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html). \
After downloading xaamp, make sure you are in the xampp\htdocs folder, open a terminal, and run: \
`git clone https://github.com/MutaMK/MasjidDashboard.git`

Open the **xampp control panel** application, and click the **Start** button next to Apache. \
That's it, now you can navigate to http://localhost/ on your browser, and look around. \
If you open http://localhost/MasjidDashboard/ you should see the dashboard run.
